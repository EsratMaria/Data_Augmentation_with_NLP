# Data Augmentation Techniques with NLP
Few NLP-based data/text augmentation techniques in order to bring more diversity to the dataset.   

### There are several augmentation techniques, in this repository, I tried two augmentation techniques:

- Adding synonyms/antonyms to the dictionary
  
  For example:
  ```
  Synonym: I like pasta. Like synonyms: alike, same, similar, etc
  Antonym: I like pasta. Like Antonyms: dislike, unlike, dissimilar, etc
  ```
- Back translation

   Translating a given source language to a target language and then translating back to the source language.

   For example:
   ```
   source lang: EN --> I have no time
   target lang: FR --> je n'ai pas le temps

   back translation: EN --> I do not have time             
  ```
